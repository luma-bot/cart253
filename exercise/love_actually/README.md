Brief
Change the “looking for love” simulation activity. Ideally, you could think of how you want to change the meaning/nature of the simulation (maybe it could be about unrequited love? Or about unwanted love? Or platonic love? Or being a fan of a YouTuber? Or something else?). Make it your simulation of love (or, if you like, change it to be about something completely different!).

Make your changes to the simulation with the following requirements:

Allow the user to control one of the circles
Anything goes, from clicking to position it, to having it follow the mouse, to using the arrow keys, to something else
Make the non-user circle move differently
Use random movement or Perlin noise or teleportation or something else!
Add at least one extra function
Not including functions any built-in p5 functions like keyPressed()
Maybe you could add a function that checks if one circle has grown too large (if they grow) or shrunk too small (if they shrink), or faded too much (if their alpha fades)
Add at least one extra ending
Maybe it could be an “easter egg” and hard to discover? (Moving the mouse to a really specific location?)
Maybe it offers a different dimension of thinking about love and loss?
Maybe it’s connected to the new function in the previous step?
