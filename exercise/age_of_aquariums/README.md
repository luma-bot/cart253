Brief
Begin with the “Aquarium” simulation activity in its final form with the ability to add a fish.

Once again, think about how you want to change the meaning/nature of the simulation (instead of fish it might be chickens, or viruses, or feelings). Make it yours. (If you want to keep it about fish, that’s okay too so long as you follow the requirements.)

Make your changes to the simulation with the following requirements:

Add a user-controlled shape (or image)
This can be controlled with the mouse or keyboard or whatever you like
Make the user interact with the fish (or whatever they are in your simulation)
It could make them disappear (eating fish? counting chickens? destroying viruses? feeling feelings?)
It could make them run away (scaring fish or chickens? Immunity to the virus? Pushing away bad feelings?)
It could attract them (fishing lure? very popular with chickens? not wearing a mask? easily overwhelmed?)
It could disappear/end the simulation if the user is touched (pecked or nibbled to death? caught COVID-19? felt too many feelings?)
Or some combination of the above, or anything else!
Remember you’ll need to use a for-loop to call a function that makes the user and each element in the array interact
Change the fish (or whatever) creation
Include more parameters so that the fish (or whatever) can be more varied (color? speed? size?)
Add at least one new property to the fish (or whatever) that changes their behaviour
Add at least two endings
Currently the simulation never ends, so make it end in at least two ways
You’ll need states to do this (at least for the simulation and the two endings, you can add a title and instructions too if you like)
Maybe you either eat all the fish or you run out of time? (A simple timer could check the frameCount variable built into p5 and when it is greater than a specific amount, the ending is triggered)
Maybe there is a special fish (or whatever) that triggers a special ending?
Submission
Submission will take place on Moodle. Go to the appropriately named exercise on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):
