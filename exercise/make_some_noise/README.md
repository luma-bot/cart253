# Anthony's Exercise 6: Make Some Noise

Brief
The core objective of this exercise is to spend time both experimenting with the p5.sound library and its possibilities (most obviously playing with sound files, oscillators, synthesizers, and audio input) alongside achieving a milestone in your final project.

As such, you should ideally produce a prototype that explores how you will use sound in your final project. This should be a stand-alone prototype (not a submission of your entire project code to this point) and should focus on the relationship of sound to your work. It should be more sophisticated that simply playing some background music and the occasional sound effect, but doesn’t have to be a work of procedural music genius. You could:

Use microphone input to control how your user’s avatar moves (if you have one)
Use microphone input to switch between scenes or to change the visuals of your project
Use a synthesizer to play musical notes when specific events take place or to play a song
Use oscillators to create dynamic sound effects (lasers! sirens! heart beats!) when things happen in your code
Use playback rate to dynamically play with sound files while your program runs to create mood
And more!
If you simply cannot or will not include some kind of sound dimension in your final project, you should instead extend on the existing activity code for the musical toy and add in some new ideas, such as:

Different kinds of balls (use inheritance) that have different musical qualities (they could use different oscillator wave forms in different ranges, they could play notes from different scale)
Add a different kind of bouncing element that plays drum sounds (find kick and snare sound files for example, and play them when these elements bounce)
Add visual effects when musical notes (or drums) are played, such as the ball briefly flashing a different color
Allow the user to drag and “throw” the balls on the screen to gain more control of their composition
And more!
