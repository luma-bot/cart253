Brief
Improve (or just change!) the COVID-19 “simulation” activity with a new interaction style, new visuals, and even a new meaning (if you like).

Your program should:

Change the way the user controls their circle
Idea: make the circle follow the mouse instead of just teleport to its location (see Movement lecture, consider acceleration if you’re feeling ambitious!)
Idea: make the user drag the circle (see Mouse input lecture)
(Optional idea: let the user control the circle with the keyboard (we’ll talk about this next week, but you could look at the keyboard documentation in the Events section of the p5 reference))
Add at least one new if-statement (including at least an else) that changes the nature of the simulation
Idea: make the COVID-19 circle move vertically toward the user while it moves left to right
Idea: make the COVID-19 circle grow if it is close to the user and shrink (back to a minimum size) when it is further away
Idea: make the user circle change color if it is moving by checking its vy and vy properties (maybe it could become harder to see?)
Change the way the simulation looks
Idea: new colors, new shapes, change the for-loop, etc.!
Idea: you could even to change what it is “about” to something else, like avoiding negative thoughts or avoiding work or even trying to catch something elusive).
Use at least one image
Read the loadImage() (pay attention to the new preload() function too!) and image() documentation.
Store your image files in assets/images in the project folder.
Submission
Submission will take place on Moodle. Go to the appropriately named exercise on the Moodle and then submit your work there.
