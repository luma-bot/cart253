/**
Exercise 1: I Like to Move It.
Anthony Lum

I like to move it move it, you like to move it move it, we like to move it!

PLAN:
- Continue to get comfortable using Git and GitHub when you work on new projects
- Declaring and changing variables (especially JavaScript objects!)

- Include three shapes
- Include movement
- Include size changes
- Include color changes
- Use map() and constrain()
- Respond to the mouse position using mouseX and mouseY
