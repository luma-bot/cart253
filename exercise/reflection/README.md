Exercise: Reflection {		
CART253 as one of my final courses in my undergrad, has been an amazing experience for an elective course. I have spent the second half of my undergrad degree in Zoom University, and it has felt draining and unfulfilling up until this course where I was happy to be learning something new and dynamic with a lot of room when it came to creative freedom. My favorite part of programming is the creative logic behind it, there is a right answer for everything in the sense of something is either going to work, or not work, and it is up to you on how you want to get there. Like the approach of math, there are different ways you can find the answer and solve the problem, and the fun part is getting there. It also helped a lot to have such a supportive circle of classmates, TA & Prof.

Some of the challenging elements were figuring out the best approach to something and not always entirely understanding certain parts of a fundamental feature to JavaScript or P5. Where moving from the example code to implementing your own does not always work and it is mainly a misunderstanding of the syntax and why certain words are where they are and sometimes figuring out what is a keyword or a user variable or a piece of syntax that is specific to a function to make it work. I am still struggling now to implement everything that I would want to do for my final project and usually a feature takes longer to do than expected, problems and glitches will always come up, as it does with any type of coding whether it’s Javascript or HTML & CSS.

I am most proud of my project 1 game where I felt that the game was coded well and felt clean in the sense of its design and code organization and did not feel like a mess nor confusing. Additionally, one of the music assignments was a lot of fun, where I decided to assign notes to keys, but I wanted the user to play the notes in a certain order, so I had to learn how to read piano notes, to know what notes to assign to what keys, it was an interesting experience, but I was invested and excited to commit to it for a small assignment.

I’m excited to be able to carry this experience and the course with me in my future design work, since I primarily work in web design, I will be able to work alongside the backend team and have a general understanding of what Javascript looks like and not feel intimidated about it, and I can always implement Javascript and P5 into my own work and online portfolio with the confidence. Excited to continue and explore Javascript and P5 on my own time post undergrad.
