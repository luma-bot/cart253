#Simulation Statement:
A barista simulator.
You are a newly hired barista working at "Good Bean Water". They didn't really give you much training to prepare you for your first shift, so there will be a lot of learning on the job!
Try not to mess up people's orders else they'll get mad. Be quick and efficient, and get those orders out so you can get paid!

#Artist's Statement:
I’d like to dedicate my undergrad degree to coffee. They have always been there for me, no matter what time of day they were there, even though some days were hot or cold, they never wavered in pushing me to strive for better, they kept me awake, alert, attentive, and kept me on my toes. Thank you for your amazing companionship coffee.

I have always enjoyed coffee and have imagined myself being a barista but am horrible when it comes to handling hot beverages. To live out my dreams, and anyone else’s of being a barista, I have created a “Barista Simulator”. The player will be working to make coffee at this local café called “Good Bean Water”, to make drinks and collect money! I would imagine the player to have an enjoyable, fun arcade like experience with the game, with a bit of random elements that I would hope lead to an addictive experience for the player to try and achieve a higher score with each playthrough.

Even though some of the assets were not made by me and are being used for educational purposes, I feel artistically I still had a hand in designing the layout of the game interface, the general styling, and still had room to add a touch of my graphic design skills when it came to adding in my own edits and changes to the assets to fit my vision of a local café.

In terms of technical skills, I felt like I had planned out a variety of variables that could simulate what a real barista would be dealing with normally, having random orders come in, where I added a specific chance for the size of drink based on the actual popularity of drinks since people tend to pick medium, I had lowered the chances of a small or large drink and then randomized the number of “pumps” for each ingredient to add some variety to people’s orders in the simulation, then adding a dollar value for each ingredient plus a random tip to be able to calculate a score and how your progress is in the game to ensure re-playability of the simulation, and to have you come back to your shift and not quit on the first day of being a barista!
