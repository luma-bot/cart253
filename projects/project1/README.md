# Project 1: Mental Health in a Box

A game by Anthony Lum, about mental health in box.
An analogy I heard about way back, turning trauma into a metaphor.
Imagine a box in your head, and ever new piece of trauma gets added to this box starts off as a really large ball.
Every time this ball bounces and hits a wall of the box, you get reminded of this trauma.
Depending on how you deal with it, the ball gets smaller sometimes until it is really small, and rarely hits the sides of the box anymore.
It still will hit the sides of the boxes sometimes but not as often as a really large ball.

I want to re-create this metaphor.
