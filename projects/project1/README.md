# Project 1: Attack of the Assignments
Anthony Lum, 40098555

Assignments are trying to attack you left and right, you must avoid getting hit by the assignments deadline, and submit them on time before it's too late!
Move your student around and avoid having the assignments and their deadlines hit you, and use your mouse to click and submit your assignments on time!
